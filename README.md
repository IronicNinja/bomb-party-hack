# Bomb Party Hack

This repository has a bot for the game "bomb party" which can be found on https://jklm.fun/. The ```chrome-extension``` folder has a failed attempt at creating the hack as a chrome extension.

The folder ```python-version``` has multiple versions of the bot and has multiple parameters. To use the bot, just make sure you provide the bot the correct jklm code and then type in ```bombv{version #}.py```. I would recommend all prospective users to use the latest version only.
